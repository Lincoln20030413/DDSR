Training for the kernel predictor:
python train.py -opt=/student/xmz/Kernel Predictor/codes/config/DDSR/options/setting1/train/train_setting1_x4.yml -opt_ker=/student/xmz/Kernel Predictor/codes/config/DDSR/options/setting1/train/train_setting1_x4_ker.yml
("-opt" has no influence on the training, which can be any other files)
